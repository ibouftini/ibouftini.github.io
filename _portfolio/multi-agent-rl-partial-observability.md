## Project Overview

This personal research project explores the intersection of representation learning and multi-agent reinforcement learning, specifically addressing the challenges of partial observability in cooperative multi-agent systems. The work introduces a novel approach called "Learning-Informed Masking" that leverages masked auto-encoders to improve learning efficiency in complex multi-agent environments.

## Key Achievements

### Performance Improvements
- **27% faster convergence** on QMIX algorithm in StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge (SMAC)
