## Project Overview

During my AI Research Internship at AI Movement (April 2025 - August 2025), I focused on enhancing multi-view breast cancer detection systems under limited data constraints. This project involved implementing and improving the cutting-edge "Act Like a Radiologist" paper for real-world medical applications.

## Key Achievements

### Performance Improvements
- **9.5% improvement** in Recall@0.5FPI over single-view baselines
- Outperformed established baselines including **MaskRCNN**, **DETR**, and **YOLO**
- Successfully adapted theoretical research to practical medical imaging challenges

### Technical Implementation
- **Multi-view Integration**: Developed sophisticated algorithms to combine information from multiple mammographic views
- **Limited Data Optimization**: Created novel approaches to handle data scarcity in medical imaging
- **Graph Neural Networks**: Leveraged GNNs to model relationships between different anatomical views

## Technical Stack

### Core Technologies
- **PyTorch**: Deep learning framework for model development and training
- **OpenCV**: Computer vision library for image preprocessing and analysis
- **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)**: For modeling multi-view relationships
- **Detectron2**: Facebook's next-generation object detection library

### Development & Deployment
- **Weights & Biases (W&B)**: Experiment tracking and model performance monitoring
- **SLURM**: High-performance computing job scheduling for large-scale training
- **Python**: Primary programming language for all implementations

## Research Impact

### Medical AI Advancement
This work contributes to the critical field of early breast cancer detection, where improved accuracy can directly impact patient outcomes. The multi-view approach mimics how radiologists naturally analyze mammograms, providing more comprehensive and reliable detection.

### Methodological Innovation
