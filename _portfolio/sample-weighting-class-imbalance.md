## üìñ Introduction

Breast cancer is a leading cause of mortality among women globally, emphasizing the critical role of early detection through mammography. In medical imaging, class imbalances and high misclassification costs (e.g., false negatives) pose significant challenges. Unfortunately, traditional performance metrics, such as the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (AU-ROC), fail to focus on critical regions of interest along the curve.

This project addresses these issues using a *Sample Weighting* technique to improve the sensitivity and specificity of deep learning models in detecting malignant regions in mammographic images.

---

## üéØ Objectives

1. **Develop and implement** AUC Reshaping techniques to optimize model sensitivity at high-specificity thresholds
2. **Integrate AUC Reshaping** into a fine-tuned deep learning model to emphasize misclassified samples in critical ROC regions
3. **Evaluate the method** quantitatively and qualitatively

## ‚öôÔ∏è Methods

### State-of-the-Art Sample Weighting Approaches

The standard methodology for mammography treatment involves:
1. **Bounding box detection** identifies suspicious areas
2. **Classification model** determines malignancy probability ‚Üê *AUC Reshaping applied here*

**Key Differences:**
- **Static**: Fixed weights throughout training
- **Dynamic**: Weights change based on model performance

### Classification Model Architecture

Our model uses a state-of-the-art ResNet-22 with CBAM attention layers. Patches (small portions of a mammogram) containing masses and calcifications are used to train this model.

#### CBAM Attention Mechanism

The model incorporates **CBAM (Convolutional Block Attention Module)** to enhance feature representation:

- **Channel Attention**: Focuses on the **"what"** aspect of features by selectively emphasizing informative feature channels
- **Spatial Attention**: Focuses on the **"where"** aspect of features by identifying important regions in the feature maps

### AUC Reshaping Theory

To enhance model's focus on critical regions, we employ an adaptive weighting mechanism informed by AUC Reshaping principles. This is mathematically formulated as follows:

Let $y_i \in \{0, 1\}$ denote the true label and $p_i$ the predicted probability for sample $i$. The reshaped loss function is:

$$\mathcal{L} = - \sum_{i=1}^N \left[ y_i \log(p_i - b_i) + (1 - y_i) \log(1 - p_i + b_i) \right]$$

where $b_i$ represents the boosting value, defined as:

$$b_i = \begin{cases}
n, & \text{if } y_i = 1 \text{ and } p_i < \theta_{\text{max}} \\
0, & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}$$

**Parameters:**
- $\theta_{\text{max}}$: High-specificity threshold
- $n$: Boosting factor, modulating emphasis on misclassified positive samples

> **Key Insight**: The AUC Reshaping function selectively modifies the ROC curve within a *Region of Interest (ROI)*, typically at high-specificity thresholds (e.g., 0.95 or 0.98). By iteratively boosting sample weights, it reduces false negatives without significantly increasing false positives.

- **CBIS-DDSM**: 1,349 UIDs
- **Zola (In-house)**: 1,233 UIDs  
- **VinDr**: 1,042 UIDs
- **Total Patches**: 6,622

#### Validation Data
- **INbreast**: 107 UIDs
- **Total Patches**: 174

### Technical Implementation

#### Threshold Calculation Strategy

We systematically evaluated different threshold updating methods:

- **Static approach**: Single calculation before training
- **Epoch-level updates**: Recalculation at each epoch boundary
- **Batch-level updates**: Dynamic adjustment during training

> **üîç Experimental Finding**: Batch-level threshold updates yielded superior performance.

#### Hardware Optimization

For effective AUC Reshaping, fine-tuning should be carried out over 1,000-2,000 epochs.

| Optimization | Implementation | Benefit |
|--------------|----------------|---------|
| Mixed Precision Training | Working on `mixed_float16` | Up to 2-3x speedup via Tensor Cores |
| Memory Management | Using Keras sequence | Optimized VRAM utilization, reduced CPU-GPU bottleneck |
| Gradient Processing | Loss scaling with `LossScaleOptimizer` | Prevents underflow in FP16, maintains numerical stability |
| GPU Optimized Libraries | TensorFlow native operations, CuPy instead of NumPy | Enhanced performance |

> **‚ö° Impact**: Optimization reduced training time from 200s to 122s per epoch
